# MySQL Utility
Fundamental actions for MySQL Database Connectivity.

This asset is designed to provide connectivity from Blue Prism to the MySQL RDBMS using the MySQL.Data managed data access library. This VBO is a code wrapper around this library and this means that the stages have C# code that undertakes the actual work. Unless you wish to modify or add functionality to the VBO C# coding experience is not needed to make use of this VBO.

Some SQL and Schema knowledge will be required to use this asset effectively.
